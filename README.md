# CI actions for seL4 repositories

This repository collects definitions for continuous integration (CI)
tasks/actions for the repositories of the seL4 foundation.

The idea is to concentrate most of the GitHub workflow definitions here in a
single repository to avoid duplication and to make it easier to replicate a
smilar CI setup on other platforms.
