name: Trigger binary verification

description: |
  Can be called from an l4v proof workflow run to trigger binary verification.

  This works by issuing a repository-dispatch event on the graph-refine
  repository, but only if there is kernel-build artifact available. The event
  starts a graph-refine binary-decompilation workflow run, which retrieves
  kernel build artifacts from the l4v proof workflow and runs the decompiler.

  The final stage of binary verification, graph refinement, is not directly
  triggered here, but may triggered by the completion of the graph-refine
  binary-decompilation workflow. Graph refinement is performed by a custom back
  end. It is expensive, so policy settings in the back end may be used to limit
  which decompilation runs actually proceed to graph refinement. The `tag`
  input be used in that policy decision.

inputs:
  token:
    required: true
    description: |
      An access token with permissions to issue a repository-dispatch event
      on the repository given in `trigger-repo`.

  tag:
    required: true
    description: |
      A brief description of the source of the event, e.g. a workflow
      identifier. This is used when reporting the results of a binary
      verification run, to help users identify the proof run that triggered the
      binary verification run.

  repository:
    required: true
    default: seL4/graph-refine
    description: |
      The GitHub repository that will receive the repository-dispatch event,
      as `owner/repo`.

  event:
    required: true
    default: binary-verification
    description: |
      The name of the event to issue on the repository given in `trigger-repo`.

  artifact:
    required: true
    default: kernel-builds
    description: |
      The name of the artifact to look for. The repository-dispatch event will
      only be issued if the artifact is present in the workflow that calls this
      action.

runs:
  using: node16
  main: index.js
