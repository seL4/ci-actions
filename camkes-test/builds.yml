# The CAmkES build matrix is a bit different, since it is mostly organised
# by app and not by build platform.
#
# For hardware builds, we use app variants on all platforms here to generate all
# theoretrically possible builds and then filter by custom app keys.
#
# For simulation builds, we just enumerate what is also enumerated in Bamboo and
# treat it separately from the normal process.
#
# See build.py for details for both parts.

# start with all apps for all modes
variants:
    app: [timeserver, serialserver_interrupt, serialserver_polling, cakeml_tipc, adder]
    mode: [32, 64]

## Custom keys for CAmkES builds:

# Hardware builds; these filter the build matrix (see build.py)
apps:
    timeserver: &std   # use timeserver as a standard template for the others
