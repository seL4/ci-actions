This action takes [sel4bench] test results and publishes them to
<https://sel4.systems/About/Performance>.

The action expects test result json file generated by the [sel4bench-hw][sel4bench-hw] action.

[sel4bench]: https://github.com/seL4/sel4bench
[sel4bench-hw]: ../sel4bench-hw/README.md

## Content

The entry point is the script [steps.sh].

[Build] and [platform] configurations are in the respective yaml and python
files in this repository. See these files for config documentation. They are
shared with the [sel4bench-hw] and sel4bench actions.

The main test driver is [build.py]. The [builds.yml][Build] file contains the
main driver information for the generated page, the template is part of the
code in [build.py].

[steps.sh]: ./steps.sh
[build.py]: ./build.py
[platform]: ../seL4-platforms/platforms.yml
[Build]: builds.yml

## Arguments

To modify the generated page, edit [builds.yml][Build] and/or [build.py] in this
directory.

- `manifest_sha`: the SHA of the manifest that the test ran on.

## Example

See for instance the [seL4/sel4bench] workflow file.
