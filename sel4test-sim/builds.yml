# A build-filter is a list of dicts. A build passes the filter if it passes any
# of the dicts. A build passes a dict, if it passes all of the criteria in the
# dict. Available criteria are all values you can set in variants and all keys
# used in builds. A build passes a key if the key is set in the build. A build
# passes a variant list, if the build value is set and present in the list.

# Example:

# build-filter:
#      - march: [armv7a]
#        compiler: [clang, gcc]
#        mode: [64]
#      - arch: [x86, riscv]
#        compiler: [gcc]
#        mode: [32]
#        simulation_binary:

# This will select all 64-bit armv7a builds with gcc or clang and all 32-bit x86
# and riscv builds on gcc with simulation_binary set.
